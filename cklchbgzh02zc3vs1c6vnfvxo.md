## Random number generator Module in Python

**True Random Number Generators (TRNG) **
A true random number generator generates a random number that is almost impossible to predict as the factors that impact changes of the resulted values are the features of physical environments. For example, throwing up a dice generates random values that are hardly predictable. But dice have limits of number from one to six. Thus, generating random numbers which is a part of mechanical nature is almost difficult to predict.

**Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNG)** 
PRNG is not a truly random number generator as an algorithm generates a sequence of random numbers. The resulted random values are generated from an initial value which is known as a seed value.

In Python, random values are generated by using the random module and the generator itself is a Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNG). The module uses the **Mersenne Twister **algorithm as its core generator which is reliable and passed many tests for statistical randomness. Also, **NumPy**offers to work with random numbers which can also generate a sequence of numbers such as different dimensional arrays. The **secret module** in python generates cryptographically strong random numbers. Pythonâ€™s** uuid (universal unique identifier )** module creates a 128 bit sequenced random value.
